With the evolving demands of e-commerce, Adobe Commerce offers various methods for extending its capabilities. These methods can be broadly categorized into `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`in-process, out-of-process, and hybrid`}</strong>{` extensibility. Each approach has its own set of advantages and use cases, and understanding them is crucial for developers and businesses looking to maximize their platform's potential.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"in-process-extensibility\"\n    }}>{`In-process extensibility`}</h2>\n    <p>{`In-process extensibility refers to the method where custom code or extensions run within the same process as the core Adobe Commerce application. This is the traditional and most commonly used approach for extending Adobe Commerce functionalities.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The advantages of this approach include:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Performance`}</strong>{` - Since the custom code runs within the same process, it can directly interact with the core application, resulting in lower latency and faster execution times.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Simplicity`}</strong>{` - In-process extensions are typically easier to develop and deploy, as they leverage the existing infrastructure and codebase.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Access to Core Functions`}</strong>{` - Developers have direct access to the core functions and data structures of Adobe Commerce, allowing for deep customization.`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`The in-process model has some considerations that you must account for:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Resource contention`}</strong>{`. Extensions share the same resources (CPU, memory) with the core application. Performance bottlenecks can be a result if these resources are not managed properly.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Stability`}</strong>{`.
